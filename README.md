[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

From the creation of this file, all future commits in this account's repository will be standardized with AngularJS Conventional Changelog. For that I will use Commitlint and Commitizen.

## Commitlint

Commitlint is a tool that allows you to standardize your commits. It helps you to commit following a predetermined pattern. You can get more information on how to use and install it in the [Commitlint Repository](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)

## Commitizen

Commitizen is a Command-Line Interface. This CLI allows you to easily commit following the conventional-changelog conventional or any other pattern. More informations on [Commitizen Repository](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
